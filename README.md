## üèÜ Best Insights
Our team (the CS Crocodiles) won the **Best Insights award** for our project where we explored the question: **"Are tech companies relocating"**. We analayzed office space lease data to find trends and created a ML model that allows commercial clients to find most suitable cities for relocation based on their business profile, needs and market.
